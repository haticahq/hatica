## 🔮 Overview

Hatica is an open source platform to launch your Internal Developer Portal.

> Community-driven, open-source platform to centralize engineering resources, with built-in analytics and workflows — simple to start, powerful to customize.

**Why Hatica?**

Building Internal Developer Portals has traditionally been a challenge—either they’re overly complex frameworks requiring significant time and effort to customize, or they’re rigid solutions that fail to meet your team’s unique needs. Hatica changes the game by offering a powerful, open-source platform that’s easy to launch and highly customizable. It’s not just a framework—it’s a ready-to-use platform designed to help you quickly create an IDP tailored to your engineering workflows, centralize resources, and empower your teams, all while staying flexible for varied workflows and future growth.
